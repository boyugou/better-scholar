# Changelog

## 2.1.0 — 2026-10-11

- **Renamed** to *Scholar Author Roles & Venue Ranks* (was "Byline", earlier "Scholar Lens"): a plain
  name for what it shows. The UI now says "rank" throughout; the GitHub repository moved to
  `boyugou/scholar-author-roles-and-venue-ranks` (the old URL redirects). Saved settings are kept.
- **Awards and talk levels the authors wrote** — *Oral*, *Spotlight*, *Highlight*, *Best / Outstanding /
  Distinguished Paper*, *Test of Time* in a paper's title or venue text become a small chip (awards in gold
  with a ★), a count in the panel that filters the list, and a line in the copied summary. A switch turns
  it off. Nothing is looked up: only the author's own words are read, and the tooltip says "not checked".
- **Paper award list** (`lib/awards.js`, `data/awards-2026.json`, 435 entries): a paper is matched to an
  award-winning paper by full title *and* first author, and tooltips say where a mark came from. Entries come
  only from official pages — the ACL Anthology's award metadata for the ACL family, and ICLR, NeurIPS and ICML's
  own awards pages (and the CVPR 2025 and ECCV 2024 best-paper pages) — each with its source and a quoted snippet. Not exhaustive: a missing paper has no mark.
  Named categories (*Best Resource Paper*, *Outstanding New Directions Paper*) show under their printed names.
- **Matcher fixes from nine more real profiles** (HCI, networking, software engineering, programming
  languages, security, graphics, theory): Computer Graphics Forum is the journal, not Computer Graphics
  International; the CHI proceedings' own name (`2018 CHI Conference on …`); SIGGRAPH proceedings
  (`… conference on Computer graphics and …`) no longer read as CGI; INFOCOM no longer read as CCS, ICSE as
  SEKE, PODS as SIGMOD; publisher names (`ACM`, `IEEE`) are not venues; `ACM Trans. Graph.` and other ISO
  abbreviations; SC, I3D, AVI, POPL names. A truncated name is no longer claimed on one common word.
- Verified once on a live Google Scholar profile: all 100 visible rows classified identically to the
  library, *Load all* and *Resolve* worked. Scholar prints a no-break space before the truncating "…";
  now covered by tests.

## 2.0.0 — 2026-10-11

Rebuilt around pure, corpus-tested libraries (names, venues, metrics, analysis): Chrome-first MV3
content-script extension, CCF 2026 (7th edition) and ICORE 2026 extracted reproducibly, role × rank
summary with filters, *Load all* and *Resolve*, English and 简体中文. See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
